# Colophon

&copy; 2010-2011 Craig S. Cottingham. All rights reserved.

Hosted at [Github](http://github.com/).

Powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/).

Makes liberal use of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
by John Gruber. Additionally, I have copied the footnote style he uses at
[Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/), at least until I can hack together something
of my own.

Tools include [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and Safari. The rest is command-line stuff,
though I've been giving [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) a whirl lately.

Things without which I couldn't (or wouldn't want to) do this:
[Apple](http://www.apple.com/) hardware. My lovely wife and daughter. And grapefruit.
