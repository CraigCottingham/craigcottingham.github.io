There was a really nice [article by Sarah Mei](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2010/05/29/outside-in-bdd/)
last year describing her process for [behavior driven development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Driven_Development).
I really recommend reading it, because it shows how she alternates between [RSpec](http://rspec.info/)
and [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/), writing features, specs, and code from the outside in.

Unfortunately, I'm still new to [Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), RSpec, and Cucumber, and her
article is aimed at a slightly more experienced developer than I currently am. I have decided to go
through the same process, starting from scratch, and document what I learn as I learn it.
