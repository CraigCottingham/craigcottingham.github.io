S3-backed EC2 instances are good for one-shot servers, which don't need to persist state
from one run to another. If you need to persist that state, however, an EBS-backed instance
is a better choice.

## Create an EBS-backed instance

The procedure for creating an EBS-backed instance is pretty much the same as for
[creating an S3-backed instance](/2011/03/16/babys-first-ec2-instance.html). There are
a couple extra parameters you can pass when launching that make sense
for EBS-backed instances.

{% highlight sh %}
  $ ec2-run-instances --group default --key ec2-keypair \
    --block-device-mapping "/dev/sda1=:16:false" --instance-initiated-shutdown-behavior stop \
    --disable-api-termination ami-1624987f
{% endhighlight %}

About the parameters and their values:

* Replace `ec2-keypair` with the name of the keypair you generated in the initial setup,
  if necessary.
* The value for `--block-device-mapping` is of the form "device=snapshot:size:delete-on-termination".
  In this case, we're saying that `/dev/sda1` will be attached to a new EBS volume, 16 GB in size,
  which will not be deleted when the instance is terminated.
* The value for `--instance-initiated-shutdown-behavior` can be either `stop` or `terminate`,
  and describes what happens to the instance if it shuts itself down (e.g. with
  `shutdown -h now`).
* `--disable-api-termination` locks the instance, keeping it from being deleted until you
  explicitly allow it.

Make sure that the instance is running.

  [ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-00-DD-83 ~]$
{% endhighlight %}

Let's have a look at the EBS volume that's being used for root.

{% highlight sh %}
  [ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-00-DD-83 ~]$ df
  Filesystem           1K-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on

  tmpfs                   859360         0    859360   0% /dev/shm
{% endhighlight %}

That's not right -- 8,256,952 1K blocks adds up to roughly 8 GB, and nowhere near the 16 GB
we specified when launching the instance.

If you don't specify a snapshot to start with when you specify a block device mapping, EC2
apparently initializes the EBS volume from some internal snapshot which is 8 GB in size.
Fortunately, it's easy to resize the filesystem to use all of the space on the volume that
we allocated.

{% highlight sh %}
  [ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-00-DD-83 ~]$ sudo resize2fs /dev/sda1
  resize2fs 1.41.12 (17-May-2010)

{% endhighlight %}

Much better.

## Test the persistence

Now, it would be good to prove to ourselves that the filesystem survives the instance being shutdown
and restarted. Copy some text to a file in the `ec2-user`'s home directory. [^fn1]

{% highlight sh %}
  [ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-00-DD-83 ~]$ echo 'Woot!' > persistent.txt
  [ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-00-DD-83 ~]$ cat persistent.txt
  Woot!
{% endhighlight %}

Shut down the instance from within itself (which we can safely do, because we specified that
the instance should stop rather than terminate, when we launched it).

{% highlight sh %}
  [ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-00-DD-83 ~]$ sudo shutdown -h now
   
  The system is going down for system halt NOW!DD-83 (pts/0) (Wed Mar 16 15:53:
  [ec2-user@domU-12-31-39-00-DD-83 ~]$ Connection to 50.17.77.114 closed by remote host.
  Connection to 50.17.77.114 closed.
{% endhighlight %}

Check that the instance has actually shut down. [^fn2]

{% highlight sh %}
  $ ec2din

  BLOCKDEVICE	/dev/sda1	vol-5a745032	2011-03-16T15:54:10.000Z
{% endhighlight %}

Restart the instance. Wait a minute for it to come up, then check to make sure that it's running.

{% highlight sh %}
  $ ec2start i-b2719add

{% endhighlight %}

Note that the public IP address changed from the previous run.
Log in, and go looking for the file that was stashed in `ec2-user`'s home directory.

{% highlight sh %}
  $ ssh -i $EC2_KEYPAIR ec2-user@50.16.85.142

Woot, indeed.

## EBS volumes are just volumes

Let's say that some process in an EBS-backed instance went haywire, corrupting the disk
enough that starting the instance causes it to lock up, and you can't even log into it
to clean it up or even figure out what's gone wrong. If this were a physical computer
with a physical hard drive [^fn3] we could pull the drive and put it into another
computer, or boot off of a different volume like a CD.

The comparable thing in the EC2 realm is to attach the volume to a running instance.
It appears in the instance as a disk device, which then can be mounted wherever you want
in the filesystem.

{% highlight sh %}
  $ ec2-describe-volumes

## An important note

Just as EC2 instances rack up charges as long as they're running, so do EBS volumes as long
as they exist. If you started an EBS-backed instance with a `--block-device-mapping` parameter
containing `false` for "delete on termination", the EBS volume will be retained even after
the EC2 instance has been terminated and garbage collected. If you don't want to keep incurring
charges for it, don't forget to delete it as well.

[^fn1]: Believe it or not, single quotes instead of double quotes in that `echo`
        make a difference.

[^fn2]: The EC2 command-line tools come in two forms: a longer, verbose form and a shorter form.
        `ec2din` is the shorter form of `ec2-describe-instances`.

[^fn3]: Well, yeah, there's obviously a physical computer with a physical hard drive
        _somewhere_.
